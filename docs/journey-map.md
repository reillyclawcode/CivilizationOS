# Resident Journey Map

## Journeys (Draft)
1. **Join** — invitation, identity verification, consent packages
2. **Vote** — agenda digest, decision packets, accessible ballots
3. **Request Support** — intake, triage, direct support, follow-up
4. **Earn/Contribute** — work opportunities, stipends, civic quests
5. **Graduate** — exit survey, credentialing, alumni network

## Research Prompts
- What context must follow a resident across every touchpoint?
- How do we represent consent, privacy, and preferred channels?
- Which flows must survive offline or low-connectivity environments?

Update this document as soon as new data arrives. Even low-fidelity field notes are useful.
