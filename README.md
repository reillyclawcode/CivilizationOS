# CivilizationOS

CivilizationOS is a companion toolkit focused on resident experience. While GovernanceOS tackles institutional structure, CivilizationOS concentrates on everyday civic rituals: onboarding, messaging, benefits, and support.

## Repository Layout

- `docs/` — research notes, service maps, and experience blueprints
- `services/` (future) — modular APIs for ID, messaging, benefits, and support routing
- `clients/` (future) — mobile/web shells, IVR flows, and offline-first kits

## Immediate Goals

1. Document the top five resident journeys (join, vote, report, request funds, graduate)
2. Prototype a unified resident profile schema
3. Map service providers and touchpoints for each journey
4. Deliver a clickable storyboard for the first journey

## Contributing

Open an issue describing the resident journey or capability you want to add. Drafts can live in `docs/` until we formalize the service contracts.
